	<p>“Live Unafraid, Die Strong.” A simple phrase, synonymous with other phrases but this one rings true.</p>
	<p>I’ve been involved in plenty of harrowing situations where it was “me or the bad guy” as a police officer.</p>
	<p>Very quickly I realized peak physical wellness was vital, not only in life or death situations but in everyday life as well.</p>
	<p>Never have I been afraid of danger, in that I personally study “Odinism” or Norse Mythology.</p>
	<p>Vikings knew their destiny so they lived and died unafraid and strong.</p> 
	<p>This lifestyle is what I wanted to instill in others.</p>
	<p>Steps by me were taken to promote combat preparedness and fitness in the county I patrolled by opening a free weight lifting class.</p>
	<p>This sparked my interest in powerlifting and assisting others to achieve greatness.</p>
	<p>With some study I rapidly grew in size and strength, learning what I could from fitness pros like Jay Cutler, Kai Greene, Jim Stoppani and the like.</p>
	<p>In time I gained a handful of endorsements to competitively lift. While I never placed in my competitions I learned so much from men and women above me.</p>
	<p>I took that experience and molded it into what you see today… The Iron Viking brand is here and I plan to outfit everyone in the best gym gear around!</p>
